This project is an example set of basic tests to written to test the restful-booker-main instance.
I ignored the existing tests that are included with that project when creating these tests.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple functioning solution to illustrate how to perform
basic testing of a simple RESTful API using a deployable solution.  This includes the ability to
execute the tests using docker containers.

/// TODO
Add instructions for:
- prerequisite installations
- - Docker Desktop
- link to restful-booker-main project
- instructions for starting the restfull booker main docker container and then the booker-tests-cypress
  project.
